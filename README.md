## 🎯 About the App

**Rick and Morty Characters app** is a frontend web platform that lets users explore, filter, favorite, and comment on characters from the Rick and Morty universe. Built using the Rick and Morty GraphQL API, the app provides a modern, dynamic experience focused on user interaction and clean design.

---

## 🧪 How to Use the App

To access all the data provided by the Rick and Morty API, you must first log in using GitHub, Google, Microsoft, or any other email provider. Once logged in, you'll be redirected to your personal dashboard, where you can:

- Browse all characters
- Filter by status, gender, and species
- Mark characters as favorites
- Soft-delete characters from your view
- Leave personal comments for each character

## 🔍 Working with the Rick and Morty API

This project uses the [Rick and Morty GraphQL API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql) via the `graphql` and `graphql-request` libraries to fetch specific data for each view using tailored queries.

Since this is a frontend-only application without a real backend, **Zustand** is used to simulate a database. User data such as favorites, deleted characters, and comments are persisted using the browser's **localStorage**.

Additionally, **Clerk** is implemented for secure authentication and protected routes, allowing access to character data only after successful login.

## 🌍 Routing with React Router DOM

Routing is a key feature in this application. The structure is managed in `App.tsx` with both fixed and nested routes. It includes:

- Route protection
- Lazy loading for performance optimization
- Dynamic routing for character details
